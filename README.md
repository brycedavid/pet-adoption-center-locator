## This project has been converted to a React.js project in adoptable-pet-finder repo

# pet-adoption-center-locator

This project is my first attempt at creating my own website. It will use the Petfinder API provided by Purina in order to help people find adoption centers
and pets that are available for adoption.

This version of the project is deprecated; all work is now being done in repo "adoptable-pet-finder" using the React.js framework.
